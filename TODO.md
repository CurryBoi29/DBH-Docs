# Docs ToDo List
(Ik its sad that we need one but its truly needed)

- [ ] Make sure all docs pages are using discord components
- [ ] Update all docs pages (Better then they were)
- [ ] Make all info clearer (Try and make everything not confusing, bc dbh members get confused too fast)

### Will continue to add more when it comes up
