# What is Redis

Redis is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall.

# Creating the server

To create a server, we suppose that you've already [created and linked an account into the panel](https://docs.danbot.dev/getting-started).

At DBH we have 2 versions of Postgres you can use, you can use Postgres14 or Postgres16. Both are the same just different versions

In that case, go to DBH server and run this command:

For a free server: `DBH!server create (Redis) [optional server name]`

For a donator server: `DBH!server create-donator (Redis) [optional name]`

# Connect to the database

In order to connect to your fresh created database start the server and use the following link:

```text
redis://default:<PASSWORD>@nX.danbot.host:<port>
```

## Fields

The link given above isn't enough for you to connect to the database, now you have to modify it to actually connect to the database.

### Node

"nX" in "nX.danbot.host" is replaced with your server's node. It can be:

| Node    | Domain              |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| PNode 1 | pnode1.danbot.host  |
| PNode 2 | pnode2.danbot.host  |
| PNode 3 | pnode3.danbot.host  |
|         |                     |
| Dono 01 | dono-01.danbot.host |
| Dono 03 | dono-03.danbot.host |

### Password

"password" can be found in the `Startup` tab.

![Password example](/content/databases/postgres.png)

<Tip>
  Given page screenshot is an example of the password, it does not carry any
  important information as the server was already deleted.
</Tip>

### Port

"port" is your server's port that can be found in the main page.

<Tip>
  **YOU MUST USE YOU'RE SERVERS PORT! IF YOU DON'T THIS WILL NOT WORK!**
</Tip>

## Final result

As soon as you finished with the link it should look like this:

```text
redis://default:th!s!snot-p-ssword@pnode1.danbot.host:1125
```
