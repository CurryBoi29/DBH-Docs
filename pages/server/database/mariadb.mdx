# What is MariaDB?

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License. Development is led by some of the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle Corporation in 2009.

# Creating the server

To create a server, we suppose that you've already [created and linked an account into the panel](https://docs.danbot.dev/getting-started).

In that case, go to DBH server and run this command:

For a free server: `DBH!server create mariadb [optional server name]`

For a donator server: `DBH!server create-donator mariadb [optional name]`

# Connect to the database

In order to connect to your fresh created database start the server and use the following link:

```text
// Have to find url
```

## Fields

The link given above isn't enough for you to connect to the database, now you have to modify it to actually connect to the database.

### Node

"nX" in "nX.danbot.host" is replaced with your server's node. It can be:

| Node    | Domain              |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| PNode 1 | pnode1.danbot.host  |
| PNode 2 | pnode2.danbot.host  |
| PNode 3 | pnode3.danbot.host  |
|         |                     |
| Dono 01 | dono-01.danbot.host |
| Dono 03 | dono-03.danbot.host |

### Password

"password" can be found in the `Startup` tab.

![Password example](/content/databases/postgres.png)

<Tip>
  Given page screenshot is an example of the password, it does not carry any
  important information as the server was already deleted.
</Tip>

### Port

"port" is your server's port that can be found in the main page.

## Final result

As soon as you finished with the link it should look like this:

```text
// Have to find url
```
