# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).

# Creating the server

To create a server, we suppose that you've already [created and linked an account into the panel](https://docs.danbot.dev/getting-started).

In that case, go to DBH server and run this command:

For a free server: `DBH!server create mongodb [optional server name]`

For a donator server: `DBH!server create-donator mongodb [optional name]`

# Connect to the database

In order to connect to your fresh created database start the server and use the following link:

```text
mongodb://admin:password@nX.danbot.host:port/?authSource=admin
```

## Fields

The link given above isn't enough for you to connect to the database, now you have to modify it to actually connect to the database.

### Node

"nX" in "nX.danbot.host" is replaced with your server's node. It can be:

| Node    | Domain              |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| PNode 1 | pnode1.danbot.host  |
| PNode 2 | pnode2.danbot.host  |
| PNode 3 | pnode3.danbot.host  |
|         |                     |
| Dono 01 | dono-01.danbot.host |
| Dono 03 | dono-03.danbot.host |

### Password

"password" can be found in the `Startup` tab.

![Password example](/content/databases/postgres.png)

<Tip>
  Given page screenshot is an example of the password, it does not carry any
  important information as the server was already deleted.
</Tip>

### Port

"port" is your server's port that can be found in the main page.

## Final result

As soon as you finished with the link it should look like this:

```text
mongodb://admin:81OCNEWWJZ1KA0TJ@pnode2.danbot.host:9608/?authSource=admin
```
